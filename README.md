# Console workshop
This is the template repository for the Console Workshop.
You can use this repo as a base for managing your dotfiles.

This will pull the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) submodule and run, check the dotbot documentation on how to configure the `install.conf.yaml`.
